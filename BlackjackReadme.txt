This is a simple game of Blackjack to be played within the command line. 

One person plays against the dealer to get to 21.
You can place a bet from a starting pool of $100, then when the game starts you can either hit (add a card to your hand) or pass (end your turn).
If you pick up an ace, you will be asked whether you want the value to be 11 or 1.

I created this game to learn how to deal with classes and get comfortable with OOP.
